From the World Health Organization - On December 31, 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This caused concern because when a virus is new, we don't know how it affects people.

Therefore, daily information about affected people can provide interesting insights if it becomes available to the broader data science community.

Johns Hopkins University has created a great dashboard using data on people who are sick. The data is extracted from linked google sheets and is available here.

I have analyzed this data and shown some visualizations.
Data was taken from kaggle.
